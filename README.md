## About MemoCard

MemoCard was born because existing apps like Anki are just too clunky. Sure, they're powerful, but they demand endless setup, don't remind you when it matters, and look like they're stuck in the past.

During the Telegram Mini App Contest, I built the flashcard app I'd been dreaming of. No configuration needed, smart reminders, and an interface that just makes sense.

Under the hood is Ebbinghaus's proven spaced repetition method. Cards pop up exactly when you're starting to forget - that's when your brain learns best.

MemoCard won a prize at the contest. Now thousands of people around the world use it to learn better.

- You're medical student aiming to memorize all the Latin names of muscles.
- You're keen on improving your geography skills, aiming to memorize countries, capitals, major cities, mountains, rivers, and other geographical facts.

- You're delving into history and want to retain key historical facts.
- You're an English teacher who wants to share your decks with your students.

## How it differs from other apps

While there are free applications like Anki available, they come with platform limitations and feature gaps:
- Anki doesn't offer a direct approach for users to privately share decks with friends or colleagues outside of its public shared decks feature. Moreover, sharing a deck demands a switch between the desktop and web versions of Anki. With the Memo Card bot, users can effortlessly share decks directly within Telegram.
- For additional functionality in Anki, users must install plugins, which are limited only to the desktop version. In contrast, the Memo Card bot is accessible on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and web versions of Telegram.
- Anki lacks automatic push notifications to alert users of upcoming reviews. It is easy to solve with Telegram push notifications
