# MobX Usage Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how MobX is used in this project, along with best practices to follow.

## Core Concepts

- **Stores as Classes**: MobX stores are defined as ES6 classes. This helps in organizing the state and related actions in a structured manner.
- **`makeAutoObservable`**: We use `makeAutoObservable` in the store's constructor to automatically make properties observable, methods as actions, and getters as computed values. This reduces boilerplate and simplifies store creation.
- **Automatic Component Updates**: The project uses `mobx-react-observer/babel-plugin`, which automatically wraps all React components with `observer`. This means you don't need to manually wrap your components with the `observer` HOC from `mobx-react-lite`.

## Global vs. Local Stores

### Global Stores

Global stores are singletons, meaning there is only one instance of the store throughout the application's lifecycle. They are suitable for managing application-wide state, such as user information, screen routing, etc.

**Definition:**

Global stores are instantiated in their own file and exported as a singleton.

```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/store/user-store.ts

import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx";
// ... other imports

export class UserStore {
  userInfo?: UserDbType;
  // ... other properties

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this, {}, { autoBind: true });
  }

  setUser(user: UserDbType) {
    this.userInfo = user;
  }

  // ... other methods and getters
}

export const userStore = new UserStore();
```

**Usage:**

Import the global store instance directly into your components or other stores.

```tsx
// MyComponent.tsx

import { userStore } from "../store/user-store";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div>{userStore.user?.name}</div>;
};
```

### Local Stores

Local stores are designed to manage the state of a specific component or a subtree of components. They are instantiated within a React component's lifecycle.

**Definition:**

Local stores are defined as classes, but they are not exported as singletons.

```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/screens/deck-review/store/review-store.ts

import { makeAutoObservable } from "mobx";
// ... other imports

export class ReviewStore {
  // ... properties

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this, {}, { autoBind: true });
  }

  // ... methods and getters
}
```

**Usage:**

Instantiate the local store within a functional component using the `useState` hook to ensure that the store instance is preserved across re-renders.

```tsx
// MyComponent.tsx

import { useState } from "react";
import { ReviewStore } from "../screens/deck-review/store/review-store";

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const [reviewStore] = useState(() => new ReviewStore());

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Use the local store */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
*Note: While this is the recommended way to use local stores, there are currently no components in the codebase that follow this pattern.*

## Best Practices

### State Persistence

Use `mobx-persist-store` for state persistence

### Avoid `useEffect` for Reactions

Instead of using `useEffect` to react to state changes, use MobX's built-in reaction functions like `autorun`, `reaction`, and `when`. This keeps your components clean and separates the view logic from the business logic.

```typescript
// packages/frontend/src/store/user-store.ts
import { autorun } from "mobx";

export class UserStore {
  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this, {}, { autoBind: true });

    autorun(() => {
      if (this.isRtl) {
        document.documentElement.setAttribute("dir", "rtl");
      } else {
        document.documentElement.removeAttribute("dir");
      }
    });
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Use Reactions Sparingly

The MobX documentation advises using reactions (`autorun`, `reaction`) sparingly. Hereâ€™s a summary of why and what to do instead:

### 1. Prefer `computed` for Derived State

Reactions run *after* an action completes, which can lead to unpredictable behavior if you rely on their results within the same action. `computed` values, on the other hand, are synchronous and update automatically, making them more reliable for deriving state.

**Instead of this (unreliable):**
```typescript
class UserStore {
  age = 15;
  isAllowed = false;
  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
    autorun(() => {
      this.isAllowed = this.age >= 18;
    });
  }
}
```

**Do this (reliable):**
```typescript
class UserStore {
  age = 15;

  constructor() {
    makeAutoObservable(this);
  }

  get isAllowed() {
    return this.age >= 18;
  }
}
```

### 2. Avoid Chains of Reactions

MobX does not guarantee the execution order of multiple reactions that depend on each other. This can lead to inconsistent state. A chain of `computed` values, however, is always calculated in a strict, deterministic order.

### 3. Group State Changes and Side Effects

Avoid creating reactions in separate, unknown parts of your application that listen for state changes to trigger side effects (like API calls). This makes the code difficult to trace and debug. Instead, explicitly call the side effect within the action that changes the state.

**Instead of this (hard to track):**
```typescript
// Somewhere in the app
reaction(
  () => articleStore.text,
  (value) => apiSaveArticle(value)
);
```

**Do this (clear and predictable):**
```typescript
class ArticleStore {
  updateText(text: string) {
    this.text = text;
    apiSaveArticle(this.text); // Side effect is here
  }
  // ...
}
```

### When to Use Reactions

- **UI Updates**: `mobx-react` uses reactions internally to update your components. You don't need to do anything for this; it's handled automatically.
- **Data Serialization**: Automatically saving data to `localStorage`, `IndexedDB`, or other external storage when it changes is a good use case for reactions.

### Simple Rules for Reactions

1.  **Don't modify other observable state** inside a reaction.
2.  **Avoid reactions that depend on each other.**
3.  **Prefer `computed` values** for deriving state.
4.  **Group side effects with the actions** that trigger them.
